# Brain-MRI-Images-for-Brain-tumor-Detection
This dataset consists of Brain MRI images, specifically curated for brain tumor detection tasks. It contains labeled MRI images, where each image is associated with a classification indicating the presence or absence of brain tumors. The dataset is designed to be used for training machine learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automatic brain tumor detection. The dataset is suitable for experiments involving the VGG19 architecture, a popular deep learning model known for its exceptional performance in image classification tasks.
